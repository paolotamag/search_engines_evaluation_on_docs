To have the script working you need to put back the necessary files in the relative folders

the MG4J package in the folder 'Homework_1_software'

the Cranfield data-set in the folder'cranData/Cranfield_DATASET'

the Time data-set in the folder'timeData/Time_DATASET'

the only think you can run without those files is the python script 1536242_plotScript.py

> python 1536242_plotScript.py
